This repository contains original code developed for https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.245111. The project was conducted along-side Bartholomew Andrews, who I would like to thank for introducing and teaching me the basics of quantum Hall systems and tensor network methods. The single-particle metrics are completely original work while the fractional Chern insulator notebooks are largeley improvised and adapted from code originally written by Bartholomew Andrews (especially regarding bond-dimension and specific DMRG parameters). I would also like to thank Professor Michael Zaletel for mentoring the project.
