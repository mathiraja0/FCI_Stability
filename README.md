This repository contains original code developed for https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.245111. The project was conducted alongside Bartholomew Andrews, who I would like to thank for introducing and teaching me the basics of quantum Hall systems and tensor network methods. The code for single-particle metrics (band structure, Wilson loops, geometric inequalities, etc.) are completely original work while the fractional Chern insulator notebooks (for the zero-quadratic model) are largely improvised and adapted from code originally written by Bartholomew Andrews (especially regarding bond-dimension and specific DMRG parameters) for the Hofstadter model. I would finally also like to thank Professor Michael Zaletel for mentoring the project and providing invaluable advice.
